# NATT Configuration Editor

The **NATT Configuration Editor** is a Visual Studio Code extension developed as part of a project at **[TBU FAI](https://www.utb.cz/en/)**. This extension facilitates the creation, editing, and execution of test configuration using the **Network Application Testing Tool (NATT)**. The tool allows users to perform black box testing on various types of software applications.

## 🌟 Features of the NATT Configuration Editor

- **📝 Intuitive Configuration Editor:** Easily create and modify test configurations with code autocomplete.
- **🧪 Execute Tests:** Directly execute and manage tests from within the extension, streamlining your workflow and providing immediate feedback.
- **📊 Test Report Viewer:** View detailed test reports within VS Code, allowing you to analyze results without leaving your development environment.
- **💡 Code Snippets:** Quickly insert common test configuration snippets to speed up the writing process.
- **🔧 Automated Setup for Local and CI Testing:** Automatically prepare all necessary files for testing on `localhost` as well as in `GitLab/GitHub` pipelines. While the pipeline setup is automated, it allows for minor adjustments, such as changing JDK versions or other specific configurations.

## 🔧 Commands

The extension provides several commands to facilitate testing:

- **🛠️ NATT Init:** Initializes the NATT testing structure by copying necessary configuration and JAR files into your project directory.
- **🚀 NATT Run:** Executes the test configuration using the NATT tool.
- **🛑 NATT Stop:** Stops the currently running test process.
- **📝 NATT Show Report:** Opens and displays the test report.
- **✅ NATT Validate:** Validates the configuration file for syntax errors.
- **🔄 NATT Reload:** Reloads the keywords list (snippets, descriptions, etc.).

## 📝 NATT Config Files

The following configuration files are used to manage NATT tests:

- **natt-args.txt:** This file contains the arguments passed to NATT.jar when running the tests. It is only used when invoking the **command NATT run through the VS Code extension**.
- **test-config.yaml:** In this file, you should implement your test configuration (test scenario). It defines how the tests will be executed.

Additionally, a script is automatically generated for both GitHub and GitLab CI/CD pipelines to run the tests as part of your automated testing process.
