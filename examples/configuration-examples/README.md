  ### Testing of simple application for email sending
  
  This configuration defines a set of automatic tests to evaluate the functionality of the email client application for sending email. The tests include scenarios related to sending emails. Each test case is designed to simulate different user interactions and verify that the client behaves as expected.

  ### Testing of telnet client
  
  This configuration describes a series of automated tests designed to assess the functionality of the telnet client application. The tests are structured to verify both the sending and receiving capabilities of the telnet client. Each test case simulates different scenarios to see if the client works correctly under different conditions.
